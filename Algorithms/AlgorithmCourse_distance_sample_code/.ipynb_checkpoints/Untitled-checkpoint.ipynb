    "#     \n",
    "# This program computes the \"distance\" between two text files\n",
    "# as the angle between their word frequency vectors (in radians).\n",
    "#\n",
    "# For each input file, a word-frequency vector is computed as follows:\n",
    "#    (1) the specified file is read in\n",
    "#    (2) it is converted into a list of alphanumeric \"words\"\n",
    "#        Here a \"word\" is a sequence of consecutive alphanumeric\n",
    "#        characters.  Non-alphanumeric characters are treated as blanks.\n",
    "#        Case is not significant.\n",
    "#    (3) for each word, its frequency of occurrence is determined\n",
    "#    (4) the word/frequency lists are sorted into order alphabetically\n",
    "#\n",
    "# The \"distance\" between two vectors is the angle between them.\n",
    "# If x = (x1, x2, ..., xn) is the first vector (xi = freq of word i)\n",
    "# and y = (y1, y2, ..., yn) is the second vector,\n",
    "# then the angle between them is defined as:\n",
    "#    d(x,y) = arccos(inner_product(x,y) / (norm(x)*norm(y)))\n",
