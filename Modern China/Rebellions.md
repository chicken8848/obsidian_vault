# Taiping Rebellion
## Hong Xiuquan
- failed provincial examination four times
- Inspired by Liang Afa
- Had an illness in 1837 where he received a dream
- Became Christian in 1843
Hong received Protestant ideas
- Taiping interpretation of "the word God": Shangdi
- Liang A-fa
Protestant missionaries in Canton also influenced him
- German missionary: Karl Gutzlaff
- 1847 Chinese Bible adopted by Hung
- Reverend Issachar Roberts (Southern Baptist missionary)
- Taught Hung for 2 months in 1847
### Tipping Point
He started to convert his fellow Hakka, and created his own church
- shelter for the victims of social disorder
- poorer peasants, miners
- motivated by the God-Worshippers' faith and ethnic identity
- Local and central governments began to suppression 1850 onwards
- Mass killing and wars between them, which anticipated a large scale rebellion
They even managed to take Nanjing in 1853. Even controlled Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hubei and Anhui.

## Impact
Exposed the real nature of the imperial institution, radical criticism of the very foundations of the Chinese imperial system. Serious ideology-based revolution, inspire later rebellions. Millenarian sects - harbingers of dynastic change.

## Millenarianism
A cultural or religious framework that predicts catastrophic change in the near future. Often there are signs that can be read to predict the coming catastrophe.

They believed in authentic worship of "Shangdi"
Taiping's own religious vision is preaching from the Bible and based on the Ten Commandments.

Taiping also criticised the Qing religious establishment
- actions of iconoclasm
- attacked Qing sacred legitimacy
- Perverse doctrines of the Confucian literati
	- deceived and destroyed the true religious order
	- bringing corruption and death to the people of China
	- imperial order blasphemous
This was a radical change in popular thought
- Authority & legitimacy of the imperial order
- Destruction of both the imperial institution and its image.

## Factors for Collapse of Taiping
- Never captured Peking, the Qing capital
- Forceful implementation of the Christian faith
- Fratricide among the Taipings
- Lack of reforms such as land distribution
- Leadership unstable
- Western powers eventually turned against the Taipings
- Zeng and his formation of the Xiang army

# Nian rebellion (1851 to 1868)
## Local politics theories / Rational actor models
- Importance of local politics
- Discounted large scale collective goals or revolutionary ideology
- Political entrepreneurship: what motivates leaders in times of political unrest?
	- ability to make use of popular organisation and motivation for their own political ends?
The harsh "ecological" environment of huabei hardened people prone to violence for survival.
- Desolated land with little commerce
- Yellow and Huai Rivers frequently changed their courses resulting in massive floods.
- Little government revenue - sorghum croop
- few government improvement works
- little governmental presence
	- banditry and formation of militia to fend off robbers
- "Patterns of group aggression"
	- peasants of hua bei had the reputation of being "Fierce and truculent"
## Coping strategies
1. predatory: robbing the others
2. protective: defending against losses
Common ground: "cooperation, mobility and high-risk behaviour"
- easily developed into "dramatic rebellions"
- "levels of social organisation" determines which strategy
Nian rebellion motivated by mundane communal "families, clans, and lineage settlements" reaction
