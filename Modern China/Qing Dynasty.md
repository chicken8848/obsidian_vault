# Education

## Zhu Xi
Made the Neo-Confucianism used in Ming Dynasty. But was written in the Song Dynasty. Promoted the cultivation via detailed study of ancient texts.
## Wang Yangming
He examined Neo-Confucianism and had thought through Zhu Xi's text. And a big point is that everyone is guided by intuitive knowledge. "I have said that knowing is the intent of acting and that acting is the work of knowing and that knowing is the beginning of acting and acting is the completion of knowing". He's talking about the "unity of moral knowledge and social action". And the common people took it very well. Since it implies that anybody can be saint, regardless of whether they studied the ancient texts.

- Common people can cultivate goodness
- Anti-elitism
- His followers refused to dress in the silk robes and caps of scholar-officials
- Mass appeal; literacy rate up
- Major influence on all Chinese reformers

### Radical followers of Wang
- Stressed intellectual independence
- Cause of factionism in imperial politics and intellectual world.
These morals also was the instrument of factional attacks between rival groups of scholar-officials. And even criticised the emperor's errant ways.

### Political Constraints of Wang's Teaching
Rationalism and objectivity of the Sung Dynasty became the more like an examination of inwards.
- ethical conduct was the root of good government
- stress on moral principles
Technology was a matter of craftsman

## Zhang JuZheng
- Strict and frugal moralist
- Tax register reform (failed)
- Land tax in silver in 1581
- Repaired Grand Canal
- Attack sinecures
- Enforce austerity
- Solvent central treasuries

# Heir Controversy
Wanli wanted to name concubine's son as heir. Even though it was common for the heir to come from a commoner. This provoked moralistic outcries of court officials, and boycotted the emperor. Wanli pursued passive-aggressive behaviour. Some of the paggro policies are
- stuffing stagnated
- neglected audiences
- memorials untouched
- ceased to govern

# Factionalism
The scholars in government banded together to fight corrupt officials and the eunuchs for control of the government. Tung-lin faction prevailed. The latter half of the rule of Wan-li was characterised by this struggle (1572-1619). The Eunuch eventually prevailed in the struggle, but the government was torn apart in the process.


# Economic Boom
## Interregional Economy
### Food Production
- Land prices dropped
- New crops are introduced from the Americas, sweet potatoes, maize, peanuts
- Advancements in irrigation and seed-sowing.
- China population 1368-1614 doubled.
There was also cash crops such as sugar, cane, tobacco, etc. There was however, too many cash crops. And when famine hit, there was a lack of land devoted to food.
### Fabric Production
There was specialised production
- Jiangan produced fabrics

Did the free market screw the Ming Dynasty?
- Ming didn't sustain mandatory famine grain depots
- Enabled commodified production of textiles
- Vulnerable to famine

## Global export of Chinese goods
There was an insatiable Japanese demand for Chinese silk.
- Ten-fold profit selling yarn to Japanese

### New World Silver
The Chinese paid so much money for good silver.
From 1581 -> no payment in kind, even peasants had to pay in silver their taxes. The problem is that it is very susceptible to inflation.

Rapid commercialization without adequate monetary policy.
- Easier to import silver in the short term than to sit down to devise a monetary policy.
Inflation became frequent as the silver supply fluctuated. They were overly dependent on silver as currency didn't delink for agriculture. In other words, the famine was both man made (taxes) and natural (ice age).

### Flow of Silver in Chinese economy
It created tremendous social mobility. Commercial desired Gentry status. Commerce funded scholarship. 
- Economic changes, urbanisation and a mini Renaissance (1520-1580)
Philanthropy seemed to redeem the elite rich's spending for pleasure.

## Travelling as recreation
There was a cultural refinement for Gentry. According to YangMing, you gotta travel to be intellectual and stuff. This gave rise to 
- Private travel
- Guide books
- Depended on courier guides
- Courier services and tribute Grand canal boats
- Promoted illegal pte letter and small goods delivery
Later commercial networks carried letters.

## Merchants and Gentry compete for status
### Merchants
Numerous and newly wealthy sought status. They needed more things to buy, anxiety about reliability of established status. Established elites also manufactured goods to sell in market - reproducing paintings of famous masters. 
### Gentry
Gentry - agents of change. They were secretly horrified that these newly rich people can pretend to be knowledgeable. 

# Obstacles to reforms
"Every dog that barks for Li is fat"

- Reforms too restricted
- Confucianism did not respect material gain
- Lack of capitalism was the downfall

## Conservative faction
- xenophobic
- ideolgues
- disrupted wen xiang's move to recruit scholars into foreign service
- argued that foreign technology is daoist magic
- discouraged participation
They also argued that "Astronomy and mathematics are of very little use". because of this conservative faction, many saw no guarantees in the western curriculum.

The Qing government was unwilling to commit itself.

Bad govt participation
- "official supervision and merchant management"
- Had a lot of govt interference and depended on govt funds
- decisions by unqualified officials
- not cost conscious about industry dev and location
Steamship company: raided for funds
- Lack plough back of profits

## Reform movement marred by extreme corruption
- Li Hung Chang: the richest man in the world
- Gentry spearheading the initiative did it for personal gain
- not for the nation's benefit
